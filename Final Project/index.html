There’s nothing like a hot bowl of noodle soup on a cold fall night. Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles in Manhattan’s Chinatown is located in a rather secluded location on Doyers Street but when you find it, expect a crowd. With an extensive menu of different bowls of noodle soup and six different types of noodles to choose from, the choices are endless. Pictured here is the Regular Hand Pulled Noodles with Pork Chop. For $7, you would be hard pressed to find such a high quality bowl of noodle soup. As the name implies, the noodles here are hand-pulled and made fresh every single day. The noodles are amazingly chewy and do not get soggy even after 15 minutes. The soup is exploding with flavor without being unnecessarily salty and that pork chop… well, what can I say? Succulent, juicy and generous. This is an absolute winner in my book. If you still have room for dessert, do try the grass jelly dessert pictured below!

How can one talk about noodle soup without going back to a perennial favorite, ramen. The Japanese staple loved by many throughout the world can be found all across New York. Ippudo is practically a household name when it comes to ramen around the globe and Ippudo Westside does not disappoint. We made the mistake of coming here on a weekend and had to wait nearly an hour before we got a table but boy, was it worth it. My friend and I had the Akamaru Ramen(pictured here) and there was just nothing to find fault with in this glorious bowl of ramen. The broth, the chashu, the noodles, even the vegetables. Everything was on point and well worth the hour-long wait. My friend even asked for Kae-dama which is extra noodles after he wolfed down the served portion and still had broth remaining.

There’s nothing like a hot cup of tea on a blustery fall afternoon. At Chiu Hong, you can get that said cup for just a dollar. Pair it with one of their freshly-baked pastries and you are in for a treat. Practically all their pastries here can be gotten for that same dollar and sinking your teeth into that warm, fluffy bun brings you to the streets of Hong Kong. Pictured here is their sweet crust bun/pineapple bun or in my native tongue, Bo Lo Bao.  Do not be mistaken though, there is absolutely no pineapple in this pastry. The top layer is made from predominantly sugar and butter and when baked, looks like the epicarp of a pineapple which gives it its name. Although Chiu Hong opens till 7pm, make sure to come in the early afternoon if you want the whole selection of their pastries since they tend to run out after 3pm. Check out the gallery below for more pictures of their pastries!

Many people come to Eldridge Street to grab a quick bite at Vanessa’s Dumplings and so often is the older, more run-down looking Shu Jiao Fu Zhou overlooked. Well, if you are reading this, overlook them no more! They serve some of the most delicious boiled dumplings in New York City and are cheaper than their more popular neighbor. They serve an excellent plate of peanut butter sauce noodles pictured below but the star of the show has to be their boiled dumplings! I had 6 of these for $2 but you can get 10 for just $3, an absolute steal. The dumplings here are plump, juicy, and filled to the brim with pork and either chives or cabbage. They are so incredibly tasty that I personally feel putting hot sauce or vinegar like most people do is overkill. Do pay Shu Jiao Fu Zhou a visit and enjoy these gems in their natural glory.

You may be wondering what an ice cream cafe is doing on a list of eateries to survive the cold but this isn’t your ordinary ice cream shop. As their name implies, this ice cream parlour serves fried, yes you read that right, fried ice cream. You can have your desired flavor of ice cream deep fried in biscuit crumbs or in oreos and my oh my, is it delicious. Crispy and hot on the outside but soft, creamy and cold on the inside, the fried ice cream is a scrumptious way to end off a cold night. My only complaint is that the spoons they provide are not robust enough to easily cut through the layer of batter but that is nit-picking a truly wonderful dessert joint.
